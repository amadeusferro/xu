# Project configuration file for the Xu Virtual Machine.
# This file defines key aspects of the project such as its name, version, main entry point,
# settings for GPU kernels, dependencies, and the runtime environment.

project:
  # Description block provides metadata about the project such as its name and version.
  description:
    # The display name of the project.
    # This is a human-readable name to identify the project and will appear in IDEs or when the project is listed.
    name: My Test Project

    # Version of the project using semantic versioning (SemVer).
    # Major (1): Increments for breaking changes or overhauls.
    # Minor (0): Increments for new, backward-compatible features.
    # Patch (0): Increments for backward-compatible bug fixes.
    version: 1.0.0

    # Defines whether this version of the project is in the alpha stage.
    # Alpha versions indicate early development stages and may contain experimental features.
    alpha: true

  # The main entry point for the Xu project.
  # This should be the file that contains the starting point of your program.
  main: project/src/test.xu

  # Indicates whether the project is configured to run as a script or not.
  # Set to true if this is a simple script, otherwise false for more complex projects.
  script: false

  # Configuration block for GPU-based kernels.
  kernels:
    # Enables or disables the execution of GPU kernels in the project.
    # GPU kernels allow the program to offload parallelizable tasks to the GPU for improved performance.
    enabled: true

    # The target GPU architecture that the kernels are optimized for.
    # This should correspond to the GPU available on the machine where the code is executed.
    # Common targets include 'nvidia' for NVIDIA GPUs, 'amd' for AMD GPUs, etc.
    gpu-target: nvidia

    # Defines the maximum amount of memory allocated to the GPU kernels.
    # This value should be set based on the GPU memory capacity and the requirements of the task.
    # Example format: "2GB", "512MB"
    memory-limits: 2GB

  # Dependencies block lists external libraries or packages that the project depends on.
  dependencies:
    # Dependency on the Xu standard library (xu-stdlib).
    # Specifies the package name and the version required for the project.
    # You can add more dependencies as needed for your project.
    - name: xu-stdlib
      version: 2.1.0

  # Environment configuration for the project execution.
  environment:
    # Toggles debug mode for the project.
    # When set to true, the project will output additional logs and information for debugging purposes.
    # Set to false for production builds to avoid excessive logging.
    debug: true

    # Optimization level for the runtime environment.
    # Determines the level of optimization applied during compilation/execution.
    # Options can be 'none', 'low', 'default', 'max', depending on how aggressively the system should optimize.
    optimization-level: max

    # Enables or disables the use of external interceptors.
    # External interceptors are user-provided hooks or extensions that can interact with or modify the virtual machine's behavior.
    enable-external-interceptors: true

    # List of external interceptors to load during runtime.
    # External interceptors can be used to perform tasks such as decompilation, profiling, or debugging.
    # Each entry in this list should point to a valid interceptor.
    external-interceptors:
      # Example interceptor for decompiling bytecode during execution.
      # This interceptor analyzes the raw bytecode and provides higher-level insights.
      - decompiler
